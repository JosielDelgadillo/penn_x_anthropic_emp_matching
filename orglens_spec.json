  "project_name": "OrgLens ",,
  "Description": "OrgLens is an internal tool that ingests data from organizational workflows (GitHub, Jira, PDFs, etc.) to build a dynamic Organization Knowledge Graph. It solves the 'Who do I ask?' problem by identifying subject-matter experts based on their actual work. It also features an AI Twin capability, allowing users to chat with a simulated version of an expert powered by Anthropic’s Claude API using historical context only.",
  "core_features": [
    "Multi-source data ingestion: Fetch and process data from GitHub (commits, issues), and internal documents.",
    "Expert Discovery Engine: Natural language search (e.g., 'Who knows about layer normalization?') returning the most relevant team member.",
    "Dynamic User Profiles: Automatically generated summaries of skills, recent contributions, and project history.",
    "AI Twin Chat: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chat interface powered by Claude 3 to mimic specific employee knowledge bases.",
    "Voice Interaction (optional): Speech-to-text and text-to-speech interface for natural conversation with AI Twin."
